## About The Project

![Screen Shot](screenshot.png)

There are many great TikTok API Wrappers available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs for NoelP X AIO. (https://youtube.com/noelp) so I created this easy to use yet advanced one. This api is so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:

* Self-Hosted
* No Ratelimits
* Dedicated Developers :smile:

Of course, no api will serve all needs since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future.

## Built With

This API is fully made (and maintained) using Python. With the FLASK module

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* Python
```sh
pip install requests
```

### Installation

This RestAPI only allows GET requests.
response = requests.get("https://noelp.live/stats?video=
*https://www.tiktok.com/@noelp_/video/7080105292943363333?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1*")

## Usage

https://noelp.live/stats?video=
*https://www.tiktok.com/@noelp_/video/7080105292943363333?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1*space. You may also link to more resources.
